# Specifying Icons

Copy and paste the code block below into your readme to add the skills icon element!

Change the `/icons?i=js,html,css` to a list of your skills separated by ","s! You can find a full list of icons [here](./docs/ICONS_AVAILABLES.md).

```md
[![My Skills](https://skill-icons.hallexcosta.com/icons?i=js,ts,react,php,go,rust)](https://skill-icons.hallexcosta.com)
```

![](https://skill-icons.hallexcosta.com/icons?i=js,ts,react,php,go,rust)

# Themed Icons

Some icons have a dark and light themed background. You can specify which theme you want as a url parameter.

This is optional. The default theme is dark.

Change the `/icons?i=<theme>:<icon-id>` to either `original`, `dark` or `light`. The theme is the background color, so light theme has a white icon background, and dark has a black-ish, if theme is not informed, the default theme is applied.

**Random Theme Example:**

```

# Icons Per Line

You can specify how many icons you would like per line! It's an optional argument, and the default is 15.

Change the `&perline=3` to any number between 1 and 50.

```md
[![My Skills](https://skill-icons.hallexcosta.com/icons?i=aws,gcp,azure,react,vue,flutter&perline=3)](https://skill-icons.hallexcosta.com)
```

# Centering Icons

Want to center the icons in your readme? The SVGs are automatically resized, so you can do it the same way you'd normally center an image.

```html
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://skill-icons.hallexcosta.com/icons?i=git,kubernetes,docker,c,vim">
    <img src="https://skill-icons.hallexcosta.com/icons?i=git,kubernetes,docker,c,vim" />
  </a>
</p>
```
